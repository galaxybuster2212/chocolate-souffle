Preheat the oven to 375˚F (190˚C).
Separate the egg yolks from the egg whites and place into two bowls.
Mix the chocolate hazelnut spread into the bowl with the egg yolks.
In the second bowl, whisk 2 egg whites until stiff peaks form.
Fold ⅓ of the whipped egg whites into the chocolate/egg yolk mixture until fully incorporated. Add the remaining egg whites to the mixture and fold gently, but thoroughly, until the mixture is smooth.
Pour the mixture into a greased ramekin. Clean the rims so the soufflé rises evenly, and bake for 15-17 minutes.
Serve immediately.
