# chocolate-souffle
Dark and intense in flavor, yet with a light and custardy texture, a chocolate soufflé is an eternal showstopper of a dessert.Soufflé came from the French word “souffler” which means “to blow up” and it is a good description of this dish as it really puff’s up during the cooking process.  A proper soufflé is a bit tricky to prepare because once it comes out of the oven it should be fully puffed and fluffy. 
But when it is ready it becomes the most exotic food you have ever tasted.
